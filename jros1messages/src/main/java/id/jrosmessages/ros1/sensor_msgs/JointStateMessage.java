 * Definition for sensor_msgs/JointState
 *
 * <p>This is a message that holds data to describe the state of a set of torque controlled joints.
 *
 * <p>This message consists of a multiple arrays, one for each part of the joint state. The goal is
 * to make each of the fields optional. When e.g. your joints have no effort associated with them,
 * you can leave the effort array empty.
 *
 * <p>All arrays in this message should have the same size, or be empty. This is the only way to
 * uniquely associate the joint name with the correct states.
